Hello,

Please find the link to the Github repository below which contains my code
for the OCR Comparison project.

My initial questions were regarding how we can transform this code to
compare upwards of 20 OCR's at a quick pace, however, since we have already
moved on from the comparison/experimentation phase I believe the code below
is a good reflection of the project!

Please let me know if you have any questions or other concerns regarding
the program, I would be happy to clarify anything further.

Best Regards,
Rohit Rajesh
